/**
 * Asset contract. File names here are fixed; the asset agent delivers files with

 *
 * All art is drawn in one 1080x1920 design space: an SVG's viewBox size IS its size on
 * screen at scale 1. `size` is that viewBox size. Every image is rasterized at its
 * native size and displayed at the same uniform scale (layout.k), so outline
 * thickness stays identical everywhere. Placeholders are drawn at the same size.
